# Project Ideas

The following is a non-prioritized list of projects that might be fun to do.

## 18650 Based Autonomous Ebike Support System

The idea is to create a secondary 18650-based (possibly Vruzend) system to power auxiliary systems on an ebike. Such a battery would support the following systems:

* Better lighting systems, including secondary lights, side lights, full LED lighting, etc.
* A comprehensive video recording system - multiple cameras
* A powerful audio speaker
* Separate power for the phone-based navigation system
* Power supply for heated grips/clothing

and other uses. Battery must be waterproof and have waterproof connections to everything.

## Solving "Education 2.0"

Schools are barely surviving with current education models. Devices and easy to consume information are stealing students' minds. Some new paradigm must be investigated in order to solve this. I'm 100% sure that the addictiveness of computers (phones, tablets) can be leveraged for purposes of education.

This is solved through:

* Gamification (visuals, achievements, league tables to compare yourself with peers)
* Bots/AI (chat, voice recognition, etc.)
* (Possibly) AR/VR, i.e. construction of a virtual environment around the student

It is, most likely, solved through the construction of learning environments around the student as interactive 3D models. These models may involve both learning as well as physical activity (similarly to Kinect exercise programs).

## Generative Architecture

Software for generative (randomly generated) architectural designs based on specifications. A client specifies parameters for generation, e.g., number of floors, total area, min/max area per room, room functions and owners, and the software creates and optimizes architectural plans.

A further goal would be to allow the client to partially fix aspects of a generated design (e.g., 'lock' one room to prevent further modification) and the software building the rest around the fixed parts.

Complications compared to orthogonal designs include:

* Curved walls and architectural deformations
* Multi-level planning: instead of slabs crossing entire floors, many slabs can exist at different levels with transitions to and from
* Special architectural elements: hidden rooms/passages, niches and architectural adjustments specifically for furniture pieces, etc.

Generative architecture software should be able to generate plans/schematics, interactive 3D models and possibly CAM specifications for demo models

## Automated Block-based Construction

Robotic implementation of block-based construction using aerated concrete or other block technology; in essence, something similar to FBR (Fast Brick Robotics).

The goal is to start with a simple loading assistant that is manually operated. The assistant will be a wheeled trolley capable of gripping and lifting a concrete block (20+kg) off the ground. The block shall then be placed manually into a prepared spot.

Further complication would allow blocks to be placed automatically (with glue application) using an automated loader that would pick up and place blocks without human interaction.

Automated construction goes hand in hand with automated design/planning as well as further automation of different processes within the constructed building.

## Car Detailing (3D Printing, CNC)

Cars mostly come with boring plastic interior detailing that can, in theory, be replaced with inserts made of wood (whole or veneer) attached to plastic supports.

Alternatively, such details can be made with transparent materials (admixed resin, multi-layered glass, transparent plastic) with backlighting using LEDs.
